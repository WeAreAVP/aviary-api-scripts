need you to do a couple things for me.  Can you

GAYHEART:  It&#039;s Joseph Tyler Gayheart, J-o-s-e-p-h T-y-l-e-r G-a-y-h-e-a-r-t.

CAMERAMAN:  Okay.  And, Tyler, do we have your full permission

GAYHEART:  You do.

CAMERAMAN:  Excellent.  All right.  Uh, I&#039;m all set.

ABNEY:  We&#039;re doing interviews for the Nunn Center Project, uh, Combat
to Kentucky, and I&#039;m sitting here with Tyler Gayheart.  Tyler, let&#039;s
get right into it as far as where you grew up.

GAYHEART:  I&#039;m originally from Frankfort, Kentucky, and--I was born in Ashland,
Kentucky, uh, but I ended up moving to Frankfort with my mom
when, uh, she was--divorced my father.  So I grew up in

ABNEY:  Okay.  What did your parents do for a living?

GAYHEART:  My mom worked for the state, and, uh, my father--uh,
who my mom was divorced from and I didn&#039;t spend too much
time with--was, uh, was an insurance salesman.  And my mom still
works for the state to this day, and they both live in
Frankfort.  And my mom has since remarried, and they both work

ABNEY:  What was, uh, what was life like for you when
you were growing up, uh, in, uh, in high school?  Uh,

GAYHEART:  My parents separated when I was around three years old.
Um, we moved to Frankfort, and my mom was a single
mother, uh, up until I was about six or seven.  My
mom remarried, uh, John Arnett which is now my stepdad, and it&#039;s
a pretty funny story.  They, uh, on the street we lived
on, um, there was a, there was a man who lived--lived across
the street, and we would always play sandlot baseball in the back
of our house.  And there were ten or fifteen kids back
there playing baseball, and we played with the typical yellow wiffle bat
and a tennis ball and used our hands to catch with.
And I remember one afternoon we were out there playing, and I
look out in the distance.  Coming from across the street there
was this man who had just moved in across the street carrying
two gloves, two balls and two bats.  And my brother was
out there playing with me, too, and unannounced he walked right up
to my brother and I and handed us two gloves, two bats
and uh--two balls and said, &quot;You guys don&#039;t need to be playing
with (laughs) tennis balls and bats.&quot;  And, uh, about six months
to a year later, he married my mom and he became my
stepdad, so, you know, looking back on it, you know, as a--as
a man right now it was a, it was a pretty good
move on his part, you know.  And he&#039;s been the best

ABNEY:  When you were in high school--and every veteran, I guess,
started out somewhere, has their own story of what high school was
like for them--but once you got into high school and you&#039;re starting
to become more aware of, you know, what it was you were
going to do when you got older, um, and you got out,

GAYHEART:  High school was erratic for me.  I had friends
in so many different circles--some going to college, some going to college
on scholarships, athletic scholarships, some not going to college at all--and I
think I fell right there in the middle between that, where I
had the ability and the intellect to go to college but I
was mature enough to know that I was too immature to do
successful, and to be successful in college.  So I think I
made a decision after I graduated.  It--it didn&#039;t dawn on me
until I had already graduated that--that I needed to do something with
more importance, uh, and something that will put me in the right
path to being successful because I knew at--at any given time that
I wanted to get my education.  I just didn&#039;t know how
I was going to do it at eighteen.  I didn&#039;t have
a college fund.  I didn&#039;t have an athletic scholarship.  Um,
as far as academics after high school goes--went for me, I was
accepted to some of the predominant state schools here in the state
of Kentucky, but I knew upon acceptance that I was neither mature

ABNEY:  So you signed up then when you were eighteen, directly

GAYHEART:  I did.  I took, uh, I took the summer
and I trained with a recruiter, and from there I went to
boot camp.  I received a phone call one summer, uh, right
after high school graduation, and it was Sergeant Dustin Barnes, uh, from
the recruiter&#039;s office in Frankfort.  And he wasn&#039;t pushy.  He
wasn&#039;t overbearing.  He just called and said, &quot;Hey, what&#039;s up?&quot;
I said, &quot;Not much.&quot;  And it was probably during the time
of the summer where I was not doing much.  Probably sitting
around playing Xbox or something really insignificant, and he said, &quot;Do you
want to do something cool?  Do you want to do something
that means something?&quot;  And I said, &quot;Well, teach me about it.
Teach me and help me learn exactly what it is that
you do as a Marine,&quot; because up until then I&#039;d had some
military figures in my life but no Marines.  I knew that
they were an elite group of--of men and women, but I--I didn&#039;t
know what it took to be a Marine.  I didn&#039;t know
what the typical Marine was like.  So I spent a summer
with him training.  Uh, we would go running five days a
week.  He would teach me about the day in the life.
He would tell me what my MOS was going to be
like.  He would tell me what his MOS was going to
be like.  He would tell me what it was like to
be eight years in, and I picked his brain and really, as
an eighteen-year-old, made a really informed decision looking back on it.
You know, before then I would have just jumped right into something,
but I knew this was going to be something really, really serious
and it was going to affect my family&#039;s life, my life.
And so I--I spent a good time contemplating before I actually stepped

ABNEY:  So it was more of an actual progression than starting
out and then eventually everything falling in place to become a Marine,
or was there something you could look back on and go, okay.

GAYHEART:  In--in grade school and for a few summers I would
go to Millersburg Military Institute, and I would spend what was two
summers there.  And that&#039;s where I got my first taste of
the military lifestyle.  Even though I was fourteen, fifteen years old,
I was living in barracks.  I was being supervised and trained
by Army--former Army sergeants and NCOs.  Uh, so they instilled this
kind of regimented attitude in me at a, at--at a young age,
and when I left the first summer, uh, after being in Millersburg,
I walked away from that wanting to go to West Point, wanting--wanting
to go to VMI.  And that was kind of the, I
guess you would say, the, the--the big militaristic--military influence that I had
when I was younger.  Um, it didn&#039;t really, it didn&#039;t really
come to realization until I was done with school and I was
looking at all my friends who had, you know, plans to go
to college and just kind of had this carefree attitude that, they
were going to go to college and go to class and uh,
graduate in three to four years or seven years.  And, you
know, I turned to my parents and I said, &quot;You know, what&#039;s
it look like?&quot;  And they said, &quot;Well, we&#039;ll probably have to
take some loans out, you know, probably have to, you know, make
ends meet, but we--we don&#039;t--monetarily we can&#039;t support you all the way
through college.&quot;  So I had to make a--a, a quick decision.
I think I fell back on my experiences at Millersburg.
And so I don&#039;t think there was a certain point.  I&#039;m
not going to say that it was always my dream, that it
was something that I stayed up at night thinking about and I
worked towards, but I think it was absolutely a, a decision that
I made over the course of seven, eight years.  I just

ABNEY:  You said that you weren&#039;t, uh, by yourself.  You
grew up around other military figures.  Are you a first generation

GAYHEART:  I am a first generation veteran from my family; however,
uh, my grandfather was in the Air Force, a really successful airman
and one of the youngest, uh, tech sergeants in uh--in the Air
Force at his time.  Enlisted, uh, unbeknownst to the Air Force
at seventeen and ended up going to OCS.  Um, the sad
thing is that I never got to meet him.  He--he died
when my sister was born, so I never got to meet him
but I&#039;d always hear stories from my grandmother about how she was
a--you know, she would go from base to base with him and--and
how he went to--she was with him when he went to OCS;
when he went from enlisted to officer.  And, and--I remember my,
probably first week back after being in the actual Marine Corps, in
the fleet, my grandmother set me down and she said, &quot;Go officer.&quot;
And at--at that point I&#039;d never received any advice from my
grandmother a--as far as military goes up until--up until then, but she
looked me square in the eye and she said, &quot;Go officer.&quot;
So, um, I wouldn&#039;t say that there was, there was a lot
of military men or women in my life, but there was that
time at Millersburg and I always seemed to uh, think that it
was such a respectful thing to do; to serve your country and
to--to make the sacrifices that the men and women did.  I

ABNEY:  What year was it that you enlisted?

GAYHEART:  2002. 

ABNEY:  2002.

GAYHEART:  August of 2002.

ABNEY:  So by that time, we already had 9/11 and then
the war in Afghanistan was ongoing, so even given an account that
you had done Millersburg before, how did--how did your parents take the

GAYHEART:  Well, like I said, I--I worked with Sergeant Barnes, the
recruiter, for three months, and it wasn&#039;t a decision that I came
to my mom and my dad and I said, &quot;Hey, this is
what I&#039;m doing. (laughs) You don&#039;t have anything to do with it.
Later; I&#039;m going to boot camp.&quot;  It was something I
warmed them up to, and I think I designed it that way
for myself and for my parents, you know, in--uh--instead of it being
a dramatic, &quot;Here it is, I&#039;m leaving.  I&#039;m going to boot
camp.  You really can&#039;t do anything about it.&quot;  I--uh, I
knew how my mom was.  I knew that it was going
to be hard for her to swallow about me going into the
military.  Um, I told them why I was doing it and
I told them that it--it wasn&#039;t because I didn&#039;t think that I
could make it through college, but I told them it was because
I needed direction and that I needed discipline and that I wanted
to be a Marine.  After spending three months with Sergeant Barnes,
I--I wanted to be a Marine.  I wanted to go to
boot camp, and I wanted to earn that eagle, globe and anchor.
And, and I think they respected that for--for, you know, uh,
a seventeen, eighteen-year-old, you know, kid to look at them and say,
&quot;This is what I want.  This is--I, I--I want this respect.
I want this, um, I want this title.&quot;  And I--I
think they looked at, looked at me and, and really respected that.
And, it--I call it--when, when people ask me about how my
parents supported me, I say it was kind of a nervous support.
It was kind of cautious support that--and they had no, you
know, some parents, they don&#039;t talk about things.  They&#039;ll just acknowledge
or not even acknowledge.  My parents did the opposite.  They
intensified and asked every single question, at least my mom.  She
made sure that this was going to happen.  She set my
boo--she set my recruiter down in our living room and said, &quot;Will
my son go to combat?&quot;  And I remember it, and if
Sergeant Barnes is watching right now.  He&#039;s a--he&#039;s probably a Gunnery
Sergeant now, and if he&#039;s watching right now.  He looked my
mom dead in the eye and said, &quot;No, ma&#039;am, he will not.&quot;
(laughs) And looking back on that it was, it was--it was comical
because there was no way, there was no way for him to
know that I would go to, I would go to Afghanistan, and,
and you know, looking back on it, I was his second person
he recruited.  Nathan Noble was the first.  So it&#039;s--I don&#039;t
know if he was hard up for a recruit or, or what,
but I can honestly say that I had a really positive experience
enlisting in the Marine Corps.  It wasn&#039;t rushed.  It wasn&#039;t,
you know, done out of impulse.  It was, it was a

ABNEY:  Did your, uh--do you think maybe that your mom kind
of supported you but felt as though you were being a little

GAYHEART:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Um, you know, and
I think if I had a--a child or--uh, a son or daughter
that was doing the same, uh, I would have thought the sa--I
would have, I would have thought the same thing. You know, he&#039;s
eighteen.  They&#039;re, they&#039;re promising him traveling, uh, uh, the respect, admiration.
You&#039;re going to be stronger, fitter, faster, sharper.  Uh, you&#039;re--you&#039;re
going to be in the best shape you&#039;ve ever been--so--so all these
things were laid out on the table, you know, and you know,
as a--as a young eighteen-year-old that, you know, whose worldview didn&#039;t leave
his front porch, this was something that I salivated at.  You
know, I wanted to get out of Frankfort.  I wanted to
go see the world.  I wanted to, you know, travel and
see things and--and meet people, and--and--and of course, of course w--when my
mom was asking me those twenty questions, of course I&#039;m going to
talk about, &quot;Yeah, but I get to do this.  I get
to do that.  And it&#039;s--it&#039;s--it&#039;s going to be something I&#039;ve never
experienced, Mom.&quot;  And--and I think, I think they, they thought that
I was a little naive and, and not sure what I was
getting myself into, but I think when I came back from boot
camp and--and I had this air of confidence and this, this direction
and every time I would come back from, you know, the fleet
or deployment and I still had that direction, I still, you know,
talked highly of the Marine Corps.  I never, during my whole
time in, talked bad about the Marine Corps.  It&#039;s given me,

ABNEY:  I think one of the biggest questions that civilians have
about veterans, about people that serve in the military is what makes
them tick and what makes them want to go in.  Uh,
so in regards to that, what were you doing--I know that a
lot of people remember exactly was going--but what were you doing on
September eleventh when--when the attacks happened inside the United States?  And,

GAYHEART:  Anger.  I was mad.  I was confused, and
I think as, as a seventeen, eighteen-year-old high school student, like I
said, whose worldview didn&#039;t leave the high school gym, or it didn&#039;t
leave his parents&#039; front porch, I didn&#039;t know what it meant.
I honestly didn&#039;t know what it meant.  I didn&#039;t know.
I knew that when it happened that, that this was going to
mean that the, that the world was going to change, that the
United States was going to change and that the way that we
operate overseas is going to over--is going to change, but I don&#039;t
think I ever reflected on how it made me feel because I
didn&#039;t understand it.  I didn&#039;t understand what it was going to
take to--to--to correct what had happened in New York.  Um, so
I think I had, I had this--you know, the whole country came
together that--that--that year.  You know, people were getting tattoos of tattered
flags and tattoos of, of, you know, bald eagles on their--on their
arms and on their chests, and there was just this movement of
patriotism that swarmed the United States.  And--and it, it--I guess it
takes something like that to bring the United States together, but I
think of how naive I was.  And this was prior to
even fathoming enlisting in the Marine Corps.  I didn&#039;t know what
it meant, and if I did, I would have enlisted right then.
And, you know, I--I--I felt anger and I, I felt like
our whole country was tricked and--and deceived, and--and I just, I just
didn&#039;t--I didn&#039;t know what it meant until I got to the Marine

ABNEY:  What--what do you think you were most angry about?

GAYHEART:  You know, you, you watch the news and you see
the people on television that are in the buildings and they would
jump, and to have that level of desperation, you know, to just
end your life although you want to live, that hit home for
me.  That&#039;s what I thought about when I would go overseas
or I was having a bad morning and I was waking up
having to go to PT or I didn&#039;t want to put on
my camis that morning or, you know, I would think about why,
why we serve and why we represent the people; why we represent
civilians and the country we live in.  And I think that&#039;s,

ABNEY:  A lot of people, once they get through the recruiter
and they finally get separated away from, um, their parents or their
home for the first time and then they finally start getting closer
to San Diego or Parris Island or whatever your--or uh, or Fort
Bragg or Benning or wherever it is that you do boot camp
at, um, start to have some immediate reservations or maybe some, uh,
real enlightenment a--about what they actually just got themselves into.  Did
you ever have a moment like that once you first arrived at

GAYHEART:  I think everybody does.  I--I remember my trip to
Parris Island probably more than I remember my deployment to Afghanistan.
You&#039;re handed this sheet of paper, and this sheet of paper has
all of the potential Marines recruits&#039; names on it that are traveling
with you.  I remember the hotel that I stayed in in
Louisville.  I remember it was right beside the airpl--the, uh, airport,
and I could hear planes going all night long.  And it
was a combination of that and going to Parris Island that kept
me up, so I didn&#039;t sleep all night.  And I woke
up and we hopped in this van, about five of us, all
from Kentucky, and we boarded a plane to go to South Carolina.
And we touched down in South Carolina and everything&#039;s fine.
We get off the plane and we--we go pick up our bags,
what little bags we have.  I don&#039;t even--it--I think maybe a
backpack--I don&#039;t even think I had a bag.  We went down
to the baggage claim, and there was this large man with a
Smokey Bear hat on and this felt that was gold on the
front of it and I knew exactly who he was.  And
he talked in this, yelled and he screamed in this raspy voice
that sounded like somebody had taken his throat and just squeezed it,
and he looks at all of us and is like, &quot;Get in
the, g--get over, g--g--g--get over there, get.&quot;  And we&#039;re scrambling in
this airport and people are staring at us, and we get on
this bus and it&#039;s nighttime.  And I remember being on this
bus, and it&#039;s quiet.  The drill instructor&#039;s not yelling anymore.
I don&#039;t even think he&#039;s on the bus, and you&#039;re on this
dar--long, dark South Carolina road.  If you&#039;ve ever been on one,
there&#039;s these tall trees and all you can see is just trees
and the lights of the highway, and, and I remember how hot
it was there and how muggy it was.  And you pull
up to the Marine Corps recruit depot at--in Parris Island, and you
get let off in front of the main, main building.  It&#039;s
this massive building.  It&#039;s got these pillars that go up, and
there&#039;s an inscription on the top of it.  And when you
get off the bus, there&#039;s these yellow footprints, and as soon as
you get off there&#039;s about five drill instructors that will so--soon become
your, you know, your platoon drill instructors.  They say, &quot;Get on
my footsteps.&quot;  So you put your feet, as simple as it

ABNEY:  What do they say to you once you, once you
get out there and everybody&#039;s, everybody&#039;s out and they&#039;re all on the

GAYHEART:  Oh, gosh.  I can&#039;t, I really can&#039;t remember.
I--it was, it was like, if you want to leave now--I don&#039;t--I
don&#039;t--I can&#039;t remember if it was--If you want to leave now, or,
you are now at the depot.  Uh, this is, you know,
they start--they start breaking you down.  You can no longer use
your--your name; you become this recruit.  Um, they take you in
the hall, and you go into this room, this--this room full of
phones.  It&#039;s a phone bank up against the wall, and they
say, &quot;Here&#039;s a script&quot; and it&#039;s taped to the wall.  They
said, &quot;Call your parents collect and read exactly what&#039;s on the wall.
Just fill in your name&quot;.  And nothing is as calm
as what I&#039;m saying.  It&#039;s all this blur of yelling and
screaming and--and chaos, and you pick up the phone, you call collect
and you say, &quot;Hi, Mom.  This is Tyler.  I&#039;m fine.
I&#039;m in the Marine Corps base uh--or Marine Corps recruit depot,
Parris Island.  I&#039;m fine.  I&#039;m healthy.  Please do not
call me.&quot;  And you hang up.  And you don&#039;t even--all
you hear is &quot;hello&quot; from them, and, and that&#039;s when it starts.
And that--that, to me, was the definition of cutting off--that communication,
that line that, you know, a young eighteen-year-old has with his parents,

ABNEY:  What, what did you feel like right then when you
realized that now your home and all your safety and everything it
is, that you had just left is now completely untouchable and it--it

GAYHEART:  I think I was in, I think I was in
autopilot for boot camp.  I was in autopilot.  I didn&#039;t,
there was--and this is true with the Marine Corps.  This is
probably more than likely true with every branch of the service--the schedules
that the military and boot camp put you on, you don&#039;t have
time to reflect.  You&#039;re on to the next thing.  You
don&#039;t have time to think, oh, man I miss home, or, oh,
man, that was, ha, that was hard.  Man, I&#039;m sore.
Oh, on to the next thing, and then--so there&#039;s no down time
to even reflect on the events that happened.  That&#039;s why, that&#039;s
why it&#039;s tough getting out of the military &#039;cause there is time

ABNEY:  So what did you find in boot camp either about
the training or about yourself maybe that you hadn&#039;t expected, that you
didn&#039;t really knew--know that you had inside you or you--you weren&#039;t expecting
the training to be, uh, to live up to what it is
GAYHEART:  Standing still.  Uh, I hated standing still and you
had to stand still in formation, and the bug</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights>All rights to the interviews, including but not restricted to legal title, copyrights and literary property rights, have been transferred to the University of Kentucky Libraries.
