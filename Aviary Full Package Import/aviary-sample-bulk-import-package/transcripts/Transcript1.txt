You have a lot of audio and video content that you want to share,

[00:00:06]
even if you have it organized, it's often hard for people to find

[00:00:10]
exactly what they're looking for. It'd be nice if people could search audiovisual

[00:00:15]
content in the same way that they search across and through text documents,

[00:00:19]
it's almost as if your audio and video files are stranded separated from

[00:00:23]
other content, it simply doesn't feel like they are being used to their

[00:00:27]
fullest potential. Enter Aviary. A platform for sharing, searching, and

[00:00:33]
